## Requirements<a name="Requirements"></a>
This system has been tested on
- Ubuntu 18.04
- MacOS 10.12 and 10.15
- Windows 10
#### Java Environment<a name="Java"></a>

The framework has been tested with the Java 12 and above.

Java Environment can be downloaded  from [this link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

#### Python Environment<a name="Python"></a>
- python version>=3.6
- numpy
- shapely
- open cv
- install the dependencies

<code>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code>

#### The Science Birds Game<a name="SB"></a>
Pre-compiled Science Birds for different platforms are in folder:

<code>ScienceBirds</code>

## Run the Agent<a name="Run"></a>
1. Run the game playing interface
	- the runnable jar file is in the root folder of the repository called game_playing_interface.jar
	- use the code below to run:

<code>java -jar  game_playing_interface.jar</code>

- Note: if you restart the game playing interface you will have to wait for about one minute, otherwise you will get an error message that the ports are still in use. 

2. Run the Science Birds game executable file to start a game instance
	- The Science Birds game used in this framework is a modified version of Lucas N. Ferreira's work that can be found in his [Github repository](https://github.com/lucasnfe/science-birds)
3. Run the Python agent 

<code>python3 main.py</code>

	- if there is any import issues, run the setup file first:

<code>python3 setup.py install</code>

4. The agent should be able to play the game automatically now

## Generate Levels<a name="Level"></a>
1. Game levels are stored in the folder:
	- Linux
	
	<code>ScienceBirds_Linux/ScienceBirds_Linux_Data/StreamingAssets/Levels/</code>
	- MacOS
	
	<code>ab.app/Contents/Resources/Data/StreamingAssets/Levels/</code>
	- Windows

	<code>ScienceBirds_Win/Science Birds_Data/StreamingAssets/Levels/</code>

2. Game levels can be dynamically added or removed to the above folder during the running of the [pipeline](#Run)
3. New levels can be generated by running 

<code>python3 IratusAves.py</code>

in folder levelgenerator
  - the level generator is based on Matthew Stephenson's work. 
  - a new version of the level generator that allows you to control many different parameters can be found [here](https://github.com/stepmat/IratusAves/tree/Sail-on).

4. A brief description about the level generator is [here](#generate)
5. A detailed description of the level generator is [here](levelgenerator/README.md)

## Outline of the Provided Files <a name="Files"></a>
This framework provided the following components:
1. The python naive agent 
	- setup.py in root folder ./
		- the setup file for the python naive agent
	- requirements.txt in root folder ./
		- the dependencies for the python naive agent
	- all source code of the agent is in ./src and will be explained in detail in a [separate section](#Code)
2. The game playing interface 
	- game_playing_interface.jar in root folder ./
		- the compiled game playing interface that handles commnication between the agent and the Science Birds game	 
3. The Science Birds game
	- three (Linux, MacOS and Windows) versions of the science birds game are provided in ./ScienceBirds
4. The level generator<a name="generate"></a>
	- located in ./levelgenerator
	- use the command:

	<code>python3 IratusAves.py</code>
	
	to generator levels

	- The levels will be generated into the same folder as the IratusAves.py
	- Currently the generated levels can be directly copied into the [game level folders](#Level) 
## Outline of the Agent Code <a name="Code"></a>
The ./src folder contains all the source code of the python naive agent. The agent is called naive agent because it ignores all other objects in the game but only aims and shoots at the pigs. Below is the outline of the code (this is a simple description. Detailed documentation in progress):
1. Files under ./src/demo/
	- naive_agent_groundtruth.py
		- A naive agent that interacts with the game by the pre-defined protocols
2. Files under ./src/client/
	- agent_client.py
		- it encodes the commands from the naive agent to send to the interface
		- it decodes the received interface messages into corresponding python object
	- server_client_config.json
		- the config file for the agent-interface connection
3. Files under ./src/trajectory_planner/
	- trajectory_planner.py
		- The implementation of the trajectory module
		- It calculates two possible trajectories given a directly reachable target point
		- It returns None if the target is non-reachable by the bird
4. Files under ./src/computer_vision
	- VisionMBR.py
		- image segmenting component that outputs a list of minimal bounding boxes (MBRs) to represent objects of a screenshot
	- VisionRealShape.py
		- image segmenting component that outputs a list of real shapes to represent objects a screenshot
	- ImageSegmentor.py
		- Implementation of region growing based image segmentation
	- GroundTruthReader.py
		- Parse the ground truth json object
		- Ground gruth data structure is detailed in [this section](#Groundtruth)
	- game_object.py
		- classes for representing game objects
	- cv_utils.py
		- utilities for vision
5. Files under ./src/utils
	- Point2D.py
		- A simple 2d point class used by the naive agent and the trajectory planner
6. ./main.py
	- main entry to run the agent

## The Game Environment<a name="Env"></a>
1. The coordination system
	- in the python naive agent and the game playing interface, the game objects are represented in a Cartesian coordinate system with the origin point to be up-left corner. X coordinate increases along the right direction and Y coordinate increases along the downwards direction.
	- in the science birds game, the origin point (0,0) is the buttom-left corner and the Y coordinate increases along the upwards direction, otherwise the same as above.
	- this is to preserve compatibility with the existing game agents based on the Chrome game. We plan to change the coordinate system of ScienceBirds to match the default coordinates (origin at top left).

## Ground Truth Data Structure<a name="Groundtruth"></a>

1. Ground truth data of game objects are stored in a Json object. The json object describs an array where each element describes a game object. Game object categories and their properties are described below:
	- Ground: the lowest unbreakable flat support surface 
		- property: type = 'Ground'
		- property: yindex = [the y coordinate of the ground line]
	- Platform: Unbreakable obstacles
		- property: type = 'Platform'
		- property: vertices = [a list of ordered 2d points that represents the polygon shape of the object]
	- Slingshot: Unbreakable slingshot for shooting the bird
		- property: type = 'Slingshot'
		- property: vertices = [a list of ordered 2d points that represents the polygon shape of the object]
	- Red Bird:
		- property: type = 'red_bird'
		- property: vertices = [a list of ordered 2d points that represents the polygon shape of the object]
	- Blue Bird:
		- property: type = 'blue_bird'
		- property: vertices = [a list of ordered 2d points that represents the polygon shape of the object]
	- Yellow Bird:
		- property: type = 'yellow_bird'
		- property: vertices = [a list of ordered 2d points that represents the polygon shape of the object]	
	- White Bird:
		- property: type = 'white_bird'
		- property: vertices = [a list of ordered 2d points that represents the polygon shape of the object]
	- Black Bird:
		- property: type = 'black_bird'
		- property: vertices = [a list of ordered 2d points that represents the polygon shape of the object]		
	- Small Pig:
		- property: type = 'pig_basic_small'
		- property: vertices = [a list of ordered 2d points that represents the polygon shape of the object]
	- Medium Pig:
		- property: type = 'pig_basic_medium'
		- property: vertices = [a list of ordered 2d points that represents the polygon shape of the object]
	- Big Pig:
		- property: type = 'pig_basic_big'
		- property: vertices = [a list of ordered 2d points that represents the polygon shape of the object]
	- TNT: an explosive block
		- property: type = 'TNT'
		- property: vertices = [a list of ordered 2d points that represents the polygon shape of the object]
	- Wood Block: Breakable wooden blocks
		- property: type = 'Wood'
		- property: vertices = [a list of ordered 2d points that represents the polygon shape of the object]
	- Ice Block: Breakable ice blocks
		- property: type = 'Ice'
		- property: vertices = [a list of ordered 2d points that represents the polygon shape of the object]
	- Stone Block: Breakable stone blocks
		- property: type = 'Stone'
		- property: vertices = [a list of ordered 2d points that represents the polygon shape of the object]	
2. ./src/computer_vision/GroundTruthReader.py is sample tool to read the parse ground truth json object. The coordination system are from the Science Birds and has been converted to the agent's coordination system.
3. Round objects are also represented as polygons with a list of vertices
4. Ground truth with noise
	- If noisy ground truth is requested, the noise will be applied to each point in vertices of the game objects except the **ground**, **all birds** and the **slingshot**
	- The position of the point with noise can be anywhere in the circle with the point's truth position as centre and 5 pixels as radius
	- The noise is uniformly distributed
	- We will later offer more sophisticated and adjustable noise.
